----
This branch contains the exact same example and workflow as the `main` branch, just backported to the RP2040 (Pico 1). I did this because there were several general workflow improvements made during the RP2350 transition (as well as a new version of the Pico SDK), and I wanted to have those improvements available for the RP2040 as well.

Additionally, proper multi-core publishing and subscribing now also works on the RP2040, unlike before. I presume the new `2.x` Pico SDK might have something to do with it.
